### Hello, I'm Jintong :wink: 
The picture above was taken by myself using my favorite film camera :camera: I love to explore the world as much as to understand it using Data Science. I am currently a Master student majoring Quantitative Methods in Social Science at Columbia University. You can find me on [![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jintong-yu/)
